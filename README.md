# Waterproof by Xylem | Let's solve water!

This is the project that was submitted at the HackZurich 2022 by team ASHA for the Xylem challenge. The repository contains two applications - `waterproof-admin` and `waterproof-employee` which are the admin/HR and employee platforms, respectively. The admin platform is a web app while the employee platform is provided as a mobile app.

## Quick Setup
1. **Admin/HR**: In `waterproof-admin`, run `python main.py` on the command line. This will launch a flask server which accepts requests for the platform
2. **Employee**: In `waterproof-employee`, extract `Waterproof 1.0.zip` and install the apk on an Android device. Alternately, one can run the application locally by running `python main.py` similar to the admin application
